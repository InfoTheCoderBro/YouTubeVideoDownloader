# YouTubeVideoDownloader
This code snippet utilizes the pytube library in Python to interact with YouTube videos and playlists.

Here's a description of what this code does:

1. Importing Required Libraries: The code begins by importing the necessary modules from the pytube library to work with YouTube videos and playlists.

2. Specifying the YouTube Video Link: You are expected to replace "Youtube video link here" with the actual URL of the YouTube video you want to interact with. This link is used to create a YouTube object named youtube_1.

3. Fetching Video Information: The script retrieves information about the YouTube video, such as its title and thumbnail URL. However, these lines are currently commented out with # symbols.

4. Listing Available Video Streams: The code fetches all available video streams for the specified YouTube video using youtube_1.streams.all(). These streams include different formats and quality options for the video. Alternatively, you can choose to download only the audio by using the commented out line #videos = youtube_1.streams.filter(only_audio=True).

5. Enumerating Video Streams: The code creates a list of enumerated video streams (vid) to display a list of available streams along with their corresponding indices. This helps the user select a specific video stream for download.

6. User Input and Video Download: The code prompts the user to enter a number corresponding to their desired video stream (strm). After the user's input, it proceeds to download the selected video stream using the videos[strm].download() method. Finally, it prints "Successfuly" to indicate the completion of the download.

7. Working with Playlists (Commented Out): Below the video download section, there are commented-out lines of code that demonstrate how to work with YouTube playlists using the pytube library. It initializes a Playlist object with a playlist link, prints the playlist title, and then proceeds to download the first video in the playlist.

Overall, this code is a basic script for downloading YouTube videos and playlists using the pytube library in Python. Users can specify the video or playlist they want to interact with, select a video stream, and download it to their local machine.
